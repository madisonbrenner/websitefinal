The only system I have used throughout my undergraduate degree has been R Studio, so I have become pretty confident in my skills using it. However, Python is a whole different story. I had never before printed "hello world" before one of the last lectures of Compuational Biology. I quickly learned though that R Studio and Python can go hand in hand as follows.

You can save variables using Python chunks:

```{python}
x= "hello world"
```

And access them using R Studion functions:
```{R}
library("reticulate")
py$x
```

Python also has useful functions

```{python}
list=[26,27,89,78,54,90,100] 
print(list)
min(list)
```

However, with Python, it is important to remember that the first integer postition is the 0th position
```{python}
list[0]
list[1]
```
