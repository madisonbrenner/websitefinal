<p>The only system I have used throughout my undergraduate degree has been R Studio, so I have become pretty confident in my skills using it. However, Python is a whole different story. I had never before printed “hello world” before one of the last lectures of Compuational Biology. I quickly learned though that R Studio and Python can go hand in hand as follows.</p>
<p>You can save variables using Python chunks:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>x= &quot;hello world&quot;</code></pre>
<p>And access them using R Studion functions:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(&quot;reticulate&quot;)
py$x</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;hello world&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Python also has useful functions</p>
<pre class="python"><code>list=[26,27,89,78,54,90,100] 
print(list)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [26, 27, 89, 78, 54, 90, 100]</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>min(list)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 26</code></pre>
<p>However, with Python, it is important to remember that the first integer postition is the 0th position</p>
<pre class="python"><code>list[0]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 26</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>list[1]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 27</code></pre>
