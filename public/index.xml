      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <title>Migrate to Hugo from Jekyll</title>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

The following data sets are titled ‘Election16’ ‘RaceData16’ and were pulled from https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html and the U.S. Census website. These two datasets together compile statistics on the demographics of voters by state in the 2016 presidential election. Election16 datasets contain the fifty states, the abbreviation for each state, the per capita income by state, the percent of high school graduates, percent of college graduates, percent of individuals with advanced degrees, the difference between republican and democrat percentages by state, and finally the winner of the election.</description>

      <description>The data chosen for this project was a large dataset compiling every gun violence indident and the number of people injured or killed in each incident. This was merged with a dataset that showed each possible gun law a state did and did not have, and this was merged with the first dataset to only display gun law and violence incidents from the entire year of 2014. The dataset contains many variables.</description>
